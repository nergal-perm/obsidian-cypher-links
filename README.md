# Project Description:

The goal of this project is to create a way to model the real world inside Obsidian
using BORO foundational ontology and principles. Moreover, the resulting model should
be directly transferable to Neo4J graph database for analysis. 

My main motivation is to have a future-proof personal computing tool. Hence the choice of 
Markdown files as the data storage and model description. 

The idea is to represent all the real world Things and their relationships as Obsidian
notes (and then the Neo4J nodes). 

@todo #1 Create the roadmap (as a list of _epics_) for the project
